# 👋 Hi, I'm Nicolas Pereira!

## 📄 About Me
I am a back-end software developer with 4 years of experience specializing in PHP, Laravel, Swoole, Docker, and Node.js. Currently at PicPay, I contribute to PIX and P2P payment projects, focusing on implementing new features and maintaining microservices to enhance system efficiency. The PIX is the primary payment method in Brazil, and in my current role, I handle a high volume of approximately 20,000 transactions per minute.

With a strong background in payment systems and fintech, I excel at documenting development processes, assisting in architectural decisions, and collaborating effectively with product teams. I am eager to embrace new challenges in the fintech domain and am actively seeking a mid-level back-end developer position. I am committed to continuously updating my skills to improve the quality and efficiency of my work.
